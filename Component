1) Components are independent and reusable bits of code. A component is a piece or part of the user interface.
2) They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
3) Components come in two types, Functional components and Class components
4) A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.
5) A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element,Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.

Example of Functional Component:

function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name} </h1>
}

Example Of Class Component:

class Welcome extends React.Component
{
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name} </h1>
    }
}
